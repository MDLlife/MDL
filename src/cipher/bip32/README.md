# go-bip32

An implementation of the BIP32 spec for Hierarchical Deterministic Bitcoin addresses as a simple Go library. The semantics of derived keys are up to the user.
[BIP43](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0043.mediawiki) and [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki) are good schemes to implement with this library.
An additional library for either or both of those on top of this library should be developed.

Modified for use in MDL, derived from https://github.com/tyler-smith/go-bip32

## Example

It's very unlikely, but possible, that a given index does not produce a valid
private key. Error checking is skipped in this example for brevity but should be
handled in real code. In such a case, an error of type  `Error` is returned and it's
method `ImpossibleChild()` will return true.

An example for handling this:

```go
func tryNewPrivateKeyFromPath() (*bip32.PrivateKey, error) {
	k, err := bip32.NewPrivateKeyFromPath([]byte("abc123"), "m/1'/1'/0/1")
	if err != nil {
		if bip32.IsImpossibleChildError(err) {
			fmt.Println("Child number 1 generated an invalid key, use the next child number")
		}
		return err
	}

	return k, nil
}
```

Any valid private key will have a valid public key so that `PrivateKey.PublicKey()`
method never returns an error.

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/MDLlife/MDL/src/cipher/bip32"
	"github.com/MDLlife/MDL/src/cipher/bip39"
	"fmt"
	"log"
)

// Example address creation for a fictitious company ComputerVoice Inc. where
// each department has their own wallet to manage
func main(){
	// Generate a mnemonic to determine all keys from. Don't lose it.
	mnemonic := bip39.MustNewDefaultMnemonic()

	// Derivce a seed from the mnemonic
	seed, err := bip39.NewSeed(mnemonic, "")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalln("Error generating seed:", err)
	}

	// Create master private key from seed
	computerVoiceMasterKey, err := bip32.NewMasterKey(seed)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalln("NewMasterKey failed:", err)
	}

	// Map departments to keys
	// There is a very small chance a given child index is invalid (less than 1 in 2^127)
	// If so your real program should handle this by skipping the index
	departmentKeys := map[string]*bip32.Key{}
	departmentKeys["Sales"], err = computerVoiceMasterKey.NewChildKey(0)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalln("NewChildKey:", err)
	}
	departmentKeys["Marketing"], err = computerVoiceMasterKey.NewChildKey(1)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalln("NewChildKey:", err)
	}
	departmentKeys["Engineering"], err = computerVoiceMasterKey.NewChildKey(2)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalln("NewChildKey:", err)
	}
	departmentKeys["Customer Support"], err = computerVoiceMasterKey.NewChildKey(3)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalln("NewChildKey:", err)
	}

	// Create public keys for record keeping, auditors, payroll, etc
	departmentAuditKeys := map[string]*bip32.Key{}
	departmentAuditKeys["Sales"] = departmentKeys["Sales"].PublicKey()
	departmentAuditKeys["Marketing"] = departmentKeys["Marketing"].PublicKey()
	departmentAuditKeys["Engineering"] = departmentKeys["Engineering"].PublicKey()
	departmentAuditKeys["Customer Support"] = departmentKeys["Customer Support"].PublicKey()

	// Print public keys
	for department, pubKey := range departmentAuditKeys {
		fmt.Println(department, pubKey)
	}
}
```
